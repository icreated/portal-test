# Idempiere Portal API Tests

## Installing / Getting started

To build this plugin you need to get sources in your project directory:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/icreated/portal-test.git
```
**Important!**
Edit pom.xml to link native Idempiere libraries with parent project.
If you put sources directly in Idempiere sources folder, it will be

```xml
<relativePath>../org.idempiere.parent/pom.xml</relativePath>
```
like others Idempiere plugins, otherwise modify it.
